## Baseline features checklist
- âœ… The video player can be started and stopped
- âœ… Trimmer should always be visible in the same screen as the video player
- âœ… Trimmer should have two drag handles on the left and right side to change the start and end point of the video respectively
- âœ… There should be some sort of indicator of the changed time while dragging either drag handle

## Bonus features checklist
- ðŸš§ Fill the background of the trimmer with thumbnails of the relative time in the video
- âœ… Change the playback of the video so that it starts at the selected start point and finished at the selected endpoint
- âœ… Add a way to export the trimmed video

## Things to improve
- Larger hit area for the trim handles without increases the size of the handles themselves
- Show an activity indicator when a video is
    - Being loaded
    - Exported
- Reduce Auto Layout boilerplate via one of two options:
    - Write an extension on UIView or a helper class
    - SnapKit
- Add video timeline thumbnails
